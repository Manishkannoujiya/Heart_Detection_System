# ðŸ«€ Overview of Heart Disease Detection System (ML Project)

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early diagnosis and prevention crucial for saving lives. The Heart Disease Detection System leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze patient health data and predict the likelihood of heart disease.

The system uses a dataset containing medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, and ST slope. These features are processed and fed into multiple ML models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.

The project provides:

Individual predictions based on user inputs.

Bulk predictions from uploaded CSV files.

Model performance comparison to evaluate accuracy across algorithms.
